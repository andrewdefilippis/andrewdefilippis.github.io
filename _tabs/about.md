Hello,

My name is {{ site.social.name }}, and I live in {{ my.Location }}.

I am married.  I am a father.  And I have been involved in technology and systems since grade school.

I formerly worked on Observability Admin and CloudWatch Logs at Amazon Web Services as a Systems Development Engineer II (L5), developing, deploying, and managing the service and its infrastructure.  Most recently, I implemented a GenAI MetaRepo and an AI MCP Server for centralized automated operations, and development.  In 2026, after 11 years with Amazon Web Services, my position within my team and org was eliminated.
