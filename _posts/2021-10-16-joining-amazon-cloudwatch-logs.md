Starting Monday the 18th of October, 2021, I will begin working within the Amazon CloudWatch Logs service team at Amazon Web Services (AWS).

I look forward to building upon the foundation of knowledge I gained in Amazon API Gateway and AWS Premium Support, and broadening my contributions and influence throughout AWS.
