Hello everyone,

After nearly 6 years of working with Amazon API Gateway, in Premium Support and within the service team, I have made the decision to transfer services.  Today is officially my last day working within API Gateway.

I leave API Gateway, having gained a wealth of knowledge and experience.  Not only in Systems Engineering (SysEng), but in Technical Project Management (TPM), Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD), Infrastructure Design, Software Design, and Software Development.

To everyone in API Gateway and Serverless MVP (ADC) that I have had the opportunity to work closely with, thank you.  Our time spent together has contributed to my growth as a Systems Engineer and Software Developer.

Best wishes,

Andrew R. DeFilippis
