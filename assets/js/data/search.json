This request for everyone to work in office, is going to have detrimental knock-on effects for everyone.Working from home (WFH) has granted me the ability to care for and deeply connect with my two young sons since March 2020. Those moments cannot be bought. No amount of income can replace the time you have available to be with your kids.Some of this extra time is spent working extended hours. It’s easy to do when you only have to walk a short distance back and forth from a home office. Or when you can bring a laptop to the kitchen and prepare lunch or dinner for family while answering messages or collaborating after-hours with colleagues on a Slack Huddle. Breaking up your day is also possible, especially when working with someone on the other side of world.Need to occasionally trade midday hours for working at night? Easy to do when WFH. You want to take your child to swim lessons shortly after business hours? Manageable. Need to make an appointment near your home? Doable.I have three hours of time in my day that would end up being wasted by driving between home and downtown Seattle. It would be four to five hours in commute time if I utilized public transit in the Puget Sound area. Not including time spent getting ready to leave home or leave the office, or drive my car to and from the transit station.In the last 8 years, I’ve ridden from South Tacoma station to King Street Station by Train, and to the Mayday office by bus. In 2015 I purchased a motorcycle to make use of the HOV lane to speed up my commute and get away from the majority of distracted drivers on I-5. I watched as I-5 gridlocked later and later into the morning and evening, making commuting worse each year.Work from home due to COVID, has been one of the greatest improvements to work-life balance I’ve experienced. No one should be forced into an office when their entire job is capable of being performed remotely. It’s not good for the community, requires us to waste our money on burning fuel, contributes to excess pollution, and wastes precious hours from our lives.When employees are forced back to the office, the end of business hours becomes a hard stop. Those extra hours get taken up by commute time. And in my opinion, those extra commute hours are business hours. https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-employee-revolt-rocking-amazon-over-return-to-work https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-02-21/tax-breaks-threaten-work-from-home-as-ceo-s-get-return-to-office-incentives https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/02/22/amazon-return-to-office-rto-petition-pusback/ https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/amazon-employees-push-ceo-andy-jassy-to-drop-return-to-office-mandate.html https://finance.yahoo.com/news/16-000-amazon-workers-joined-110817418.html https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-mayor-praises-amazons-back-to-office-policy-in-state-of-the-city-address/" }, { "title": "Joining Amazon CloudWatch Logs", "url": "/posts/joining-amazon-cloudwatch-logs/", "categories": "Career, AWS", "tags": "cloud, aws, amazon, cloudwatch logs, api gateway", "date": "2021-10-16 21:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Starting Monday the 18th of October, 2021, I will begin working within the Amazon CloudWatch Logs service team at Amazon Web Services (AWS).I look forward to building upon the foundation of knowled...", "content": "Starting Monday the 18th of October, 2021, I will begin working within the Amazon CloudWatch Logs service team at Amazon Web Services (AWS).I look forward to building upon the foundation of knowledge I gained in Amazon API Gateway and AWS Premium Support, and broadening my contributions and influence throughout AWS." }, { "title": "Transferring Teams at AWS", "url": "/posts/transferring-teams-at-aws/", "categories": "Career, AWS", "tags": "cloud, aws, amazon, cloudwatch logs, api gateway, premium support, email", "date": "2021-10-15 16:40:00 +0000", "snippet": "Hello everyone,After nearly 6 years of working with Amazon API Gateway, in Premium Support and within the service team, I have made the decision to transfer services.
